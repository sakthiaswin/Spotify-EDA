# Spotify Music Data Analysis

This project involves the analysis of Spotify music data using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly. The dataset contains information about various musical attributes of songs, including acousticness, danceability, duration, energy, instrumentalness, key, liveness, loudness, mode, speechiness, tempo, time signature, valence, target, song title, and artist.

## Dataset Description

- **Number of Rows and Columns**: 2017 rows, 16 columns
- **Data Types**: Float64 (10 columns), Int64 (4 columns), Object (2 columns)
- **Missing Values**: No missing values found

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### Data Cleaning
- Removed the "Unnamed: 0" column.
- No further cleaning required as there were no missing values.

### Summary Statistics
- Descriptive statistics were calculated for numerical columns:
  - Mean, Standard Deviation, Minimum, Maximum, Quartiles, etc.

### Distribution Plots
- Histograms were plotted for all numerical columns.
- Pairplot was created to visualize relationships between different features.

### Top Artists and Tracks
- Top 10 most popular artists were identified based on the count of their songs.
- Top 5 loudest tracks, most danceable songs, most energetic songs, top acoustic songs, and top instrumental tracks were also analyzed.

### Feature Analysis
- Scatterplots were generated to visualize the relationship between various features and energy.

## Results and Insights
- The dataset includes a diverse range of musical attributes, spanning from acousticness to danceability and energy.
- Some tracks exhibit extreme values in terms of loudness, danceability, energy, etc.
- Certain artists dominate the dataset with a higher number of songs.
- The analysis reveals interesting patterns and correlations between different musical attributes.

## Conclusion
This analysis provides valuable insights into the characteristics of Spotify music data. By examining various features, we gain a deeper understanding of the musical landscape and can potentially derive insights for music recommendation systems or genre classification algorithms.

## Instructions for Running the Code
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install the required libraries using `pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn plotly`.
3. Download the dataset (data.csv) and update the file path in the code.
4. Run the provided code in a Python environment or Jupyter Notebook.
